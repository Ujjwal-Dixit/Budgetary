# Budget App Project

This is a JavaScript project that allows users to track their income and expenses and manage their budget. The application provides a user interface where users can add income and expense items, view their budget summary, and delete items as needed. The project consists of multiple JavaScript classes that handle different aspects of the application, including the budget calculations, user interface updates, and event handling.

## Features

- Add income and expense items: Users can input the description and value of each income or expense item they want to track.
- Budget calculation: The application calculates the total income, total expense, overall budget, and expense percentage based on the provided items.
- Item deletion: Users can delete specific income or expense items from the list.
- User-friendly interface: The user interface provides clear visuals of the budget summary, including income, expenses, and the overall budget. The expense items also display the percentage they contribute to the total income.
- Event handling: The application responds to user actions, such as button clicks and key presses, to perform the necessary operations.

## Usage

Launch the application by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.
The application displays the current month and year in the budget title.

To add a new income or expense item:

- Select the item type (income or expense) from the drop-down menu.
- Enter a description for the item.
- Enter the item value.
- Click the "Add" button or press Enter to add the item to the list.

The newly added item will appear in the respective list (income or expenses) with the description and value.

To delete an item:

- Locate the item in the list.
- Click the delete button (represented by a cross icon).
- The item will be removed from the list, and the budget summary will be updated accordingly.

The budget summary displays the total income, total expenses, overall budget, and expense percentage.

## Acknowledgements

The Budget App project was created using JavaScript and follows the module pattern. It utilizes various JavaScript concepts, such as classes, event handling, and DOM manipulation. Shoutout to **Jonas Schmedtmann** for the guidance.
